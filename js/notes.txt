AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript) : Javascript is normally synchronous and single threaded language. Synchronous executes code one after the other and single threaded means execute only one code at a time.
console.log("hi");
console.log("bye")
 

Asynchronous Javascript allows to execute code, not immediately.
Asynchronous Javascript allows to execute only specific code with
interuppting other codes(UI).
eg. adding item to cart or score update in crickbuzz etc...,

we can use browser default timers to understand AJAX, browser provides two default methods called
        i. setTimeOut
        ii.seetInterval

i. setTimeOut : it is used to perform a tassk after a specific time setTimeOut(callback funciton , time in ms).
    eg: setTImeOut(()=>console.log("hello world"),1000)
    it print hello world after 1s
    in case if any other code is next to it, it will get executed immediately.

ii.setInterval : it is used to perform a task every time of specific interval. 
    setInterval(callback funciton, time in ms)
    eg : setInterval(()=> console.log("hello world"),1000)
    it prints hello world for every 1s

we can stop these using clearTimeOut and clearInterval
    clearTimeOut(variable of setTimeOut)
    clearInterval(variable of setInterval)


BOM(Browser Object Model): Browser provide an object to control the complete  browser(not web page),"window"
The methods like alert, prompt ,confirm,setTimeout, setInterval, fetch and objects like console, document are all part of window object
It have default methods like

    i.basic usage: we can open or close the window using 
    window.open(url)
    window.close() or variable.close()

    ii. history: we cannot access the actual hsitory pages but we can access methods like
    back() --- used to go back
    forward() --- used to go forward
    
    
    iii. location : we can access current webpage details using window.

    location
        href --- complete web pages url
        Search -- only search urls
        reload() -- reload the current web page
        replace -- replaces the current web page url

    iv.geolocation : we can access feo location using window .navigator.geolocation
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(res) => 
    ({
         console.log(res.coords.latitude,res.coords.langitude)
    },(err) =>{
        console.log(err)
    })

    vi. local storage vs session storage:
        Browser can even store the data using local storage or session storage
        local storage is permanant and stays even after browser closes.
        session storage is temporary and will get expired once the browser closes 
        local storage can be shared to all tabs but session storage stays for only one tab

        local or session storage uses similar methods such as 
        localStorage.setItem(itemName,value) -- always it stores values as strings
        localStorage.getItem(itemName)
        localStorage.clear()
        localStorage.removeItem(iteName)

    Libraries: Librarie is a prewritten code for specific purpose

        Most Famous JAVASCRIPT libraries are 
            1. JQuery
            2. Axios
            3. React
            4. SLick/ swiper js /owl carousel/ tns slider
            5. AOS(animate on scroll)
            6. GSAP
            7. THree JS/animate js
            8. chartjs/am4charts


    how to use a libraries?
    1. take library cdn link and attach to HTML,
    2.  Read doc and apply necessary changes.

    ES6: ES stands for ECMAScript. ECMAScript is the standard that js follows. if JS is like a chef, then ECMAScript is a like a recipe book. 
    every anew features needs to be added to JS, a new version of ES will be released . ES6 released in 2015 also called ES2015. THe latest version is ES2024 or ES15 
    ES6 actuakky brought lot of revolutionary features such as  
        i. let & const
        ii. template literals
        iii.Arrow Functons
        iv.default parameters
        v. Promises/Async Await
        vi. OOP(object oriented programming)
        vii. destructuring Array/objects
        viii. Rest of the parameters and spread operator
        ix. ES6 Module System

    vi.OOP(object oriented programming)
: 
it is way of writing code
problem : jack wants six packs
solutions1: wake up early --> hit the gym --> dosome exercises --> maintain diet --> repeat for some year
sloution2 : frist build muscles --> build some biceps --> some chest --> do some abs
solution3: check what i needs for six packs --> verify constantly what you --> do what is needed

The third approsch explians object oriented programming. it constantly focus on objects.
Object is a physical entity which have properties and methods 
class is a standard/blueprint of a object. it contains multiple objects so can be called as collection of objects

class Fruit{
color;shape;name;taste;
}
apple is an object which is from class Fruit
//To create object we use a keyword new -- to generate dynamic memory
let apple = new Fruit();
let banana =  new Fruit(); 



//Inheritance : when a class is derived from another class it is called Inheritance


class carousel{
    cmodel.mileage;price;
    constructor(a,b,c){
        this.model =a;
        this.mileage =b;
        this.price =c;
    }
}
let obj1 = new Car("tata punch","20kmph",6);
console.log(obj1.mileage)

class ElectricCar extends Car{
    batteryCapacity;
    constructor(a,b,c,d){
        super(a,b,c);
        this.batteryCapacity = d;
    }
}
let obj2 = new ElectricCar("tesla", 20kmph,70,"10hr")

destructuring of objects or arrays:
    let arr = [5,4,6,9];
    let [a,b,c,d] = arr;

    let obj = {name : "shakhar",age:55}
    let{name,age} = obj;
    let {name,age} = obj; //destructuring of object

Rest of the parameters : 
        it is representedby three dots and it is used  to collect all the rest of parameters 
        and store them as an array. it is always written at last of parameters.
        let [a,..b]=["raj","shekhar","jhon"]
        console.log(a) //raj
        console.log(b) //["shekhar","jhon"]


Spread operator : 
    it is used to spread out the array. it is also represented by three dots 

let a =[1,2],b=[3,4];
let c=[..a,..b];
console.log(c) //[1,2,3,4];
