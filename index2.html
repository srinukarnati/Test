    <h1>HTML presentation and Tags:An In-Depth Look </h1>
    <p>
        The page provides an extensive demonsstration of various HTML tags specifically designed for text formatting and presentation.
         It highlights how these tags influence the visual appearence and semantic meaning of content without reluing on exxternal CSS. 
    </p>

    <h2>Text styling and Emphasis Tags</h2>
    <p>
        These tags are used to apply common text styles like bold,table,undereline, and to convey different levels of emphasis or semantic meaning.
    </p>
    <h3>Bold and Strong Emphsis</h3>
    <p>
        This sentence contains text that is rendered in a <b>bold</b> font style using the b tag.The b tag is typically used for visually bolding text without adding any special semantic importance.
        Conversely,this sentence has text that conveys <b>strong importance</b> using the string tag.While it often renders as bold, its primary purpose is to indicate that the content is of greater importance or seriousness.
        Consider using strong for keywords in a warning or crtical information, and b for names in an article or product names that don't need semantic emphasis.
    </p>
    <h3>Italic and Emphasized Text</h3>
    <p>
        Here,we have text that is displayed in an <i>italic</i> font using the i tag. The i tag is generally used for text that needs to stand out visually, such as technical terms, foreign words, or thoughts.
        This sentence showcases text that is <em>emphasized</em> using the em tag.The em tag adds semantic emphasis, implying that the content should be stressed or pronounced differently.
        For instance, use em when you want to emphasize a word in a sentence to change its meaning, and i for titles of works or scientific  names.
    </p>
    <h3>Underlined and Inserted Text</h3>
    <p>
        This text is <u>underlined</u> using the u tag. Historically, this was used for visual underlining,but it's now often discouraged for non-hyperlink text to avoid confusion. It can be used to represent text that is unarticulated but explicitly rendered as if underlined, such as misspellings.
        This text is <ins>inserted</ins> using the ins tag. Thua tag semantically indicates content that has been added to document,often rendered eith an underline.
        You can also specify a datetime attribute for ins to indicate when the content was inserted: <u>New content added on Jan 15, 2023</u>.
    </p>
    <h3>Strikethrough and Deleted Text</h3>
    <p>This text is <s>struck through</s> using the s tag.this tag indicates content that is no longer accurate or relevant,but should not removed from the document. It's purely presentational.
        This text is <del>deleted</del> using the del tag. This tag semantically indicates that has been removed from a document, often rendered with a strikethrough.
        Similar to ins, del can have a datetime attribute: <del>Old price:$29.99 </del> New price: $24.99.
    </p>
<h3>Subscript and Superscript</h3>
<p>Chemical formulas often use subscripts, like H<sub>2</sub>O (water) where the '2' is a sub element.
Mathematical expressions or ordinal indicates use Superscript, such as E=mc<sup>2</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup>,where the '2' and 'th' are sup elements.
</p>
<h3>Marked (Highlighted) Text</h3>
<p>The mark tag is used to <mark>highlight</mark> or mark text that is of particular relevance in the context of the surrounding content, often rendered with a yellow background.</p>
<h3>Small Text</h3>
<p>This is normal text, and this is <small>small text</small> using the small tag. It typically represents side comments, copyright, or legal disclaimers.</p>
<h3>Cited Work</h3>
<p>
    The cite is used todenote the title of a work. For example, as famously quoted from <i>Hamlet</i> by William shakespeare, "To be or not to be, that is the question."
Another example: The theory was first proposed in <i>On the Origin of Species.</i>
</p>

<h2>Code, Variables, and Preformatted text</h2>
<p>
    These tags are crucial for displaying programming code, user input, sample output, and preserving text formatting.
</p>
<h3>Code Snippets</h3>
<p>
    For inline code, use the code tag. For example, to print"Hello, World!" in python, you would use <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>.
    When defining a function in JavaScript: <code>function great() { console.log("Hi"); }</code> 
</p>
<h3>KeyBoard</h3>
<p>The kbd tag indicates user input, typically from a keyboard To save a document, press Ctrl+s.
    To open the task manager on Windows, press Ctrl + shift + Esc.
</p>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<p>
    The samp tag represents sample output from a computer program. If the command fails, you might see: <code>Error: permission denied</code>.
    After a successful compulation, the concole might display: <code>Build successful (0 warnings, 0 errors).</code>
</p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>The var tag is used to deffine a variable in a mathematical expression or programming context In the formula for the area of a circle,A= &#960;r<sup>2</sup>,A represents the area and r represents the radius.
Another example: Let <i>x</i> be the number of apples.</p>
<h3>Performattedd Text</h3>
<p>The pre tag preserves whitespace and line breaks exactly as are written in the HTML source code, making it ideal for displaying code blocks or ASCII art.
    <pre>
        <code>
        function example(data) {
            if (data === null) {
                return "No data";
            }
            return data. length;
        }
        
        This is a sample 
        multi-line 
        text block.        
    </code>
    </pre>
 </p>

    <h2>Quotes and Blockquotes</h2>
    <p>These tags are used for quoting text from other sources, distinguishing between short inline quotes and longer, block-level quotes.</p>
    <h3>Short Quotes</h3>
    <p>The q tagis used for short quotations. My friend , "I'll be there in five minutes!" befire hanging up.
        Another common phrase is, "Actions speak louder than words."
    </p>
    <h3>Blockquotes</h3>
    <p>The blockquotes tag is used for longer quotations that are typically displayed as a block. It often includes a citation.
          <blockquote>"two roads diverged in ayellow wood. And sorry I could not travel both And be ine traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth."</blockquote>
          <blockquote><i>--Robert Frost, The Road Not taken</i></blockquote>

<h2>semantic text elements (Beyond Basic Styling)</h2>

<p>The abbr tag is the standard HTML tag used to define both **abbreviation** and **acronyms** It's important for providing the fill, expanded form of a shortend word or phase. which helps with accessibility and search engine optimization.
    You use the title attribute to provide the full description. When a user hovers oer the abbreviated text, the full form usually appears as a tooltip. <br>
    <p>For example:  is <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> the standard markup language for creating web pages. This applies to acrronyms too, like <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.</p>
</p>
<p>The oldeer acronym tag was used specifically for acronyms, but is has been deprecated in HTML5. The abbr tag should now be used for all types of abbreviation, including acronyms, to maintain modern web standards.</p>
